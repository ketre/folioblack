            To identify an international organisation in order to develop your proposal or collaboration. Use an
            in-depth research to produce a series of formative insights, which will then be used to create a proposal in
            support of a market research, communications campaign and/or strategy shift.

            <span style="font-size: larger;">My process</span> <br> <br>
            This project was a submission for the Marketing and Communications Unit, which explores the theories and
            principles of contemporary marketing communications tools and practices and sets them within a global,
            cultural, social and historical context. As the timeline for this project happened to be at the same time
            England went into a lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it was crucial to consider the impact the global
            pandemic was about to have on local and international businesses. The company of my choice was Ubereats, and
            the strategic proposal I did after a thorough market research and trend forecasting, is a hypothetical
            marketing strategy aimed at helping local restaurants by increasing the volume of orders.
            Namely, joint-delivery, a semi-permanent promotion would encourage people from the same and neighbouring
            apartemnt complexes to make a joint order from one of the local restaurants to be delivered in one vehicle
            at a set time, saving both on the transportation costs and the hustle of choosing what to have for dinner.
            Global economic slowdown and inevitable crisis as a result of the worldwide pandemic are affecting all
            markets, and local boutique restaurants are the ones hit the hardest in the food service industry. As a
            corporate partner, UberEats has neccessary resources and power to alleviate the damage done to some of the
            restaurants due to new regulations - 'Cafes, pubs and restaurants must close as soon as possible - except
            for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus'. (PM Johnson, 2020)
