            Our team wanted to create a series of exhibitions facilitated by and for students at UAL.
            The events will be comprised of Alumni talks on embracing failure to create a feeling of community and
            relieve the pressure of not being allowed to fail.
            The exhibited works are collected from current students as the work they discard for various reasons but,
            most often, because its 'just not good enough'.
            Studying at one of the best art universities in the world can be daunting, and many students at UAL feel the
            pressure to always be successful in their creative endeavours.
            No Pressure! is an exhibition which celebrates failure and experimentation by displaying works, which were
            never intended to be seen by the general public.
            Exhibition to take place in a space which is easily accessible and has infrastructure neccesary to display
            different media.
            <br><br>
            <span style="font-size: larger;">My process</span> <br> <br>
            My primary role was that of a project manager - I was ensuring coordination of our team members and keeping
            up with the timeline for the brief.
            I have negotiated the place for the final exhibtion and arranged it to be advertised across UAL's social
            media channels. The exhibition was also promoted on the ticket selling platform Eventbrite and was free to
            attend.
            I've been in close contact with the artists who reached out to exhibit their work and produced the written
            component of our final pitch to be delivered to the panel.
            The exhibition turned out to be a successful affair with many student admiring the work which was once
            discarded by its creators.
