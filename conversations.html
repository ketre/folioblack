                To listen and record a variety of conversations, dialogue, comments that you hear outside of the
                college.
                Listen carefully and record what is heard or misheard as accurately as possible, asking yourself if is
                there's an accent, is the voice soft, loud, quiet or harsh?
                All notes to be transcribed and reproduced in a series of 4 of these voices of London as: A series of
                postcards start by using only type and
                two colours.

                <span style="font-size: larger;">My process</span> <br> <br>
                This project was a one-day workshop to view typography as the driving force in the form of visual
                communication.
                I've experimented with typogrpahic layots and semantics with the use of static vs dynamic compositions,
                negative space, and chaotic vs organised alignment. Different techniques produced a result which is
                associated with the respective tones of voice and the emotional characteristic of the recorded phrase.
                Various font sizes and weights were used to communicate the implied hierarchy of the words in question,
                making them feel 'alive'.
